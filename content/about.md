# Hello.
## My name is Ringo Chan.

I am a software engineer focus on DevOps and cloud-native technology. Most of my work is open source and publicly available on GitHub. You can follow me on Twitter where I mostly tweet about my projects and DevOps technologies.

If you happen to speak Chinese, my Chinese name is 陳詠鋒. You can also find me on 微博 and 知乎.

Outside of programming and helping my wife take care of our 3 kids, I enjoy playing table tennis, swimming, bushwalking, karaoke and tinkering around my home.
